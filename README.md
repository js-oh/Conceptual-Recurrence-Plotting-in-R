# Conceptual-Recurrence-Plotting-in-R

This is a R code for implementing conceptual recurrence plotting (CRP) in R. 

To see its implementation in analyzing psychotherapy transcripts, refer to my article here (LINK TO THE ARTICLE AFTER PUBLISHING).

For technical details about CRP, refer to these [original](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5887327) [articles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6161608) by Angus, Smith, & Wiles.
